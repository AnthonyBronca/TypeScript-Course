/*

Write a function calculateArea that calculates the area of a rectangle.
The function takes two parameters: length and width.
The function should return the area of the rectangle,
which is the product of length and width.




calculateArea(3,9) //18
calculateArea(10,3) // 30

//Comment these out before running tsc
calculateArea('10',3) // should show an error around '10' before tsc
calculateArea()//should show an error under calculateArea before tsc
