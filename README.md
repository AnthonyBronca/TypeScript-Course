## READY TO START???!

Before you begin the course, please set up your coding enviornment to support TypeScript. I will be assuming you are using VS Code

## Mac Installation

Open the Terminal application on your Mac.

Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in the terminal:

```
brew install node
```

Verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly by running the following commands:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

node version should be: version 16.0.0 or greater
npm version should be: 9.0.0 or greater

Install TypeScript by running the following command in the terminal:

```
npm install -g typescript
```

Verify that TypeScript is installed correctly by running the following command:

```
tsc -v
```

Version should be 4.8.3 or greater

If the command outputs the version number of TypeScript, then it has been successfully installed on your Mac.

Note: If you encounter any permission errors during the installation, you may need to run the above commands with sudo privileges by prefixing them with sudo.

## Windows Installation

Download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Open the Command Prompt application on your Windows machine.

Verify that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed correctly by running the following commands in the Command Prompt:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

node version should be: version 16.0.0 or greater
npm version should be: 9.0.0 or greater

Install TypeScript by running the following command in the Command Prompt:

```
npm install -g typescript
```

Verify that TypeScript is installed correctly by running the following command:

```
tsc -v
```

Version should be 4.8.3 or greater

If the command outputs the version number of TypeScript, then it has been successfully installed on your Windows machine.

Note: If you encounter any permission errors during the installation, you may need to run the above commands with Administrator privileges by right-clicking on the Command Prompt and selecting "Run as administrator".
