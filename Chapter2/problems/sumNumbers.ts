You are working on a TypeScript project that includes a function sumNumbers
 that takes an array of numbers and returns their sum.
 However, you recently made some changes to the function, and
 now you are not sure if it still works correctly.

Your task is to write some test cases using TypeScript assertions to
verify that sumNumbers works as expected.

to test this function run (make sure you are in the root dir):

npm test

function sumNumbers(numbers){
//TODO:
}

export default sumNumbers
